## ... and my personal website

### About Me

My name is Chris. I'm a software engineer in San Diego, CA. My focus is in web
development, but I also enjoy experimenting with machine learning and video
game development.

### About the Personal Website

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator.
Haven't played with it too much, but I love its simplicity with static content
using Markdown and its ability to use React components for dynamic content.

The source code for this site is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cmoles/personal-website). Have fun!
