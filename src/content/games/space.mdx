I adapted a Favicon Game Jam entry for A Game By Its Cover Jam 2024. The original concept is by game artist [Seth Kumpf](https://linktr.ee/SethKumpf). Loved the imagery of cave man in space fighting UFOs. The description attached to the cover:

> After saving the galaxy, Genshi took a much needed rest, that is until he came across a blast from the past! Martians are invading Earth 65 million years ago in order to wipe out the dinosaurs! Can Genshi and Maia stop the Red Planet Rising!?

The code will be up on [GitHub](//github.com/cmoles). It will also hosted on [Itch.io](//mindlessturtle.itch.io/). Will update this page as I make updates to the game.

## Objective

    - Destroy UFOs and save dinosaurs.

## Controls

    - Arrows - move

    - Z - hit

    - X - shoot
