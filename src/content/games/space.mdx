I adapted a [Favicon Game Jam entry](https://famicase.com/24/softs/093.html) for [A Game By Its Cover Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2024). The original concept is by game artist [Seth Kumpf](https://linktr.ee/SethKumpf). Loved the imagery of cave man in space fighting UFOs. The description attached to the cover:

> After saving the galaxy, Genshi took a much needed rest, that is until he came across a blast from the past! Martians are invading Earth 65 million years ago in order to wipe out the dinosaurs! Can Genshi and Maia stop the Red Planet Rising!?

I also adapted music by [Robby Duguay](https://www.robbyduguay.com/) from his ["Nine Songs in Pico-8" cart](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2619).

The code will be up on [GitHub](//github.com/cmoles). It will also hosted on [Itch.io](//mindlessturtle.itch.io/). Will update this page as I make updates to the game.
