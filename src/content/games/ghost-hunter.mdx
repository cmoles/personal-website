### Overview

I adapted a Favicon Game Jam entry for A Game By Its Cover Jam 2023. The original concept is by game artist [Gabby DaRienzo](//gabbydarienzo.com/). Loved the colors and the idea of having ghost friends. The description attached to the cover:

> Glenda loves ghosts but no one believes in them except her! Using her trusty shovel and lantern, dig up graves and search for new  ghost friends. But be careful -- some graves are cursed!

The code is up on [GitHub](//github.com/cmoles/ghost-hunter). It's also hosted on [Itch.io](//mindlessturtle.itch.io/ghost-hunter). Will add to this page as I make updates to the game.
