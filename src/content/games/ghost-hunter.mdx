### Overview

I adapted a Favicon Game Jam entry for A Game By Its Cover Jam 2023. The original concept is by game artist [Gabby DaRienzo](//gabbydarienzo.com/). Loved the colors and the idea of having ghost friends. The description attached to the cover:

> Glenda loves ghosts but no one believes in them except her! Using her trusty shovel and lantern, dig up graves and search for new  ghost friends. But be careful -- some graves are cursed!

The code is up on [GitHub](//github.com/cmoles/ghost-hunter). It's also hosted on [Itch.io](//mindlessturtle.itch.io/ghost-hunter). Will add to this page as I make updates to the game.

### Objective

- Dig up all the graves.

### Ghosts and Skeletons

- Ghosts are your friend and will follow you under your command. They can attack skeletons, but they get hurt from it. They will heal when they follow you.

- Skeletons are your enemy. They will make your ghosts friends go away.

### Controls

- Arrow keys to move
- Z / (O-button) to start and prepare to dig
- X / (x-button) to jump
- Hold Z + Tap X to dig
- Hold X + Tap Z to command ghosts
