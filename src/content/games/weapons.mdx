_What else are you gonna play at 2:17 am?_

Inspired by the summer horror film [Weapons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26581740/) (2025), this game uses the mechanics from the movie to be used as a strategy game. **Please watch the movie before reading about or playing this game.** It's a good movie, and I'd hate for anything to be spoiled for you.

### Objective

Collect people's possessions and ring a bell to possess them! Use them to collect hair for your witch. With hair, you can send any of possessed people to attack the hair's owner. Sounds weird, but it's pretty cool in the movie. Let's try making it a game!

You can play against the CPU, another player, or watch the CPU battle itself. You can even use Demo mode to have the game play itself forever. Fun to use as a screen saver.
