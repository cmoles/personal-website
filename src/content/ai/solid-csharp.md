Here are examples for each of the SOLID principles using C#:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

   The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In C#, you can adhere to this principle by ensuring that each class has a single responsibility.

   ```csharp
   public class UserService
   {
       public void RegisterUser(User user)
       {
           // Register the user
       }
   }

   public class EmailService
   {
       public void SendConfirmationEmail(User user)
       {
           // Send a confirmation email
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `UserService` class is responsible for user registration, and the `EmailService` class is responsible for sending emails. Each class has a single responsibility.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**:

   The OCP states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You can achieve this in C# by using inheritance and interfaces to extend functionality.

   ```csharp
   public abstract class Shape
   {
       public abstract double Area();
   }

   public class Circle : Shape
   {
       public double Radius { get; }

       public Circle(double radius)
       {
           Radius = radius;
       }

       public override double Area()
       {
           return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
       }
   }

   public class Square : Shape
   {
       public double Side { get; }

       public Square(double side)
       {
           Side = side;
       }

       public override double Area()
       {
           return Side * Side;
       }
   }
   ```

   You can add new shapes (e.g., `Triangle`) without modifying the existing `Shape` or concrete shape classes.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:

   The LSP states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In C#, you should ensure that derived classes can be used interchangeably with the base class.

   ```csharp
   public class Bird
   {
       public virtual void Fly()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Bird is flying");
       }
   }

   public class Penguin : Bird
   {
       public override void Fly()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Penguin can't fly");
       }
   }
   ```

   Here, a `Penguin` object can be used in place of a `Bird` object without affecting the program's correctness.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:

   The ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. In C#, you can design interfaces with specific, small sets of methods.

   ```csharp
   public interface IFlyable
   {
       void Fly();
   }

   public interface ISwimmable
   {
       void Swim();
   }

   public class Bird : IFlyable
   {
       public void Fly()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Bird is flying");
       }
   }

   public class Fish : ISwimmable
   {
       public void Swim()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Fish is swimming");
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, classes can implement only the interfaces relevant to their behavior.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:

   The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In C#, you can use dependency injection to achieve this.

   ```csharp
   public interface IDataService
   {
       string GetData();
   }

   public class DatabaseService : IDataService
   {
       public string GetData()
       {
           // Retrieve data from a database
           return "Data from the database";
       }
   }

   public class FileService : IDataService
   {
       public string GetData()
       {
           // Read data from a file
           return "Data from a file";
       }
   }

   public class DataProcessor
   {
       private readonly IDataService dataService;

       public DataProcessor(IDataService dataService)
       {
           this.dataService = dataService;
       }

       public string ProcessData()
       {
           var data = dataService.GetData();
           // Process data
           return data;
       }
   }
   ```

   The `DataProcessor` class depends on the `IDataService` abstraction, which can be implemented by different data sources like `DatabaseService` or `FileService`. This adheres to the DIP.
