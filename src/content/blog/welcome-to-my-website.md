### The website is up! We've got liftoff! ðŸš€

Introducing my new personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). I'm still learning how to use Astro, so I'm sure there will be some changes in the future. But for now, I'm happy with the way it looks.

I'm also using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the website. I've never used Netlify before, but I'm liking the results. It's easy to use, and it's free. What more could you ask for?

I'm also using [GitHub](https://github.com/cmoles/personal-website) to host the source code for the website. Unfortunately, I've neglected my GitHub account for, well, practically, my entire software engineering career. Fortunately, this website is the perfect project to add to it.

### What's next?

And that's what's next. Adding more projects to my GitHub account and feature
them here on my website. I'm also going to add a blog to the website focused
primarily on programming. The following is a list of topics I plan to cover:

-   [web development](/tags/web-development)
-   [machine learning](/tags/machine-learning)
-   [game-development](/tags/game-development)

> Note: I'm gonna need to make a goals component as one of my projects to add to

What's missing right now are social media links. I'm not sure if I want to add
those or not. I'm not really on any of them except for LinkedIn. I might
resurrect my ~~Twitter~~ X account. But do I really want to? Does Elon pay
people to post? ðŸ¤”

### What's the point?

Eventually, I want this website to be a place where I can showcase my work. Most
of my work has been private, so I need to start breaking out and start sharing
my work with the world. I'm also hoping to use this website as a way to connect
with other developers. Shoot, maybe I do need to join social media. ðŸ¤·
