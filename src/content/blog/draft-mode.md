### Do I need a draft mode?

I'm not sure. I'm going to try it out and see how it goes. First we'll test this
guy and see if it works or not. I suppose I can keep my drafts in a separate
branch, but I kinda like the idea of sharing my work in progress on
[GitHub](//github.com/cmoles/personal-website). Let's see how it goes, and if it doesn't work out, we'll remove it.
