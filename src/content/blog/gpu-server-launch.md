### Launching a GPU Server

I'm excited to announce that I'm launching a GPU server for machine learning and
data processing tasks. This server will be used for various projects, including
deep learning, data analysis, and other computationally intensive tasks. For
now, I have Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI running on it, but I plan to
add more applications in the future.

### Accessing the Server

I'm limiting access to the server to a few trusted friends and colleagues. Let
me know if you're interested in accessing it, and I'll add you to the list.
