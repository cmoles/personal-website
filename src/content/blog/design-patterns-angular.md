Here are examples of some commonly used design patterns in Angular:

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**:

   In Angular, you can implement a Singleton pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of a service throughout the application. This is often used for managing shared state or resources.

   ```typescript
   @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
   export class MySingletonService {
     // Your service logic here
   }
   ```

   By providing the service at the root level using `{ providedIn: 'root' }`, Angular will create a single instance of `MySingletonService` for the entire application.

### 2. **Observer Pattern (Observable)**:

   Angular makes use of the Observer pattern through the use of Observables. For example, you can use Observables to handle asynchronous events and data streams.

   ```typescript
   import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

   const dataStream: Observable<any> = /* ... create an observable */;

   dataStream.subscribe((data) => {
     // Handle the data when it arrives
   });
   ```

   Angular's HttpClient, for making HTTP requests, returns Observables that allow you to subscribe to responses.

### 3. **Factory Pattern**:

   The Factory pattern is used to create objects based on certain conditions. In Angular, you can use a factory method to create instances of components or services dynamically.

   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-dynamic-component',
     template: 'Dynamic Component',
   })
   export class DynamicComponent {}

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-factory',
     template: '<ng-container #container></ng-container>',
   })
   export class FactoryComponent {
     @ViewChild('container', { read: ViewContainerRef }) container: ViewContainerRef;

     constructor(private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver) {}

     createDynamicComponent() {
       const componentFactory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(DynamicComponent);
       const componentRef = componentFactory.create(this.injector);
       this.container.insert(componentRef.hostView);
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, the `FactoryComponent` dynamically creates instances of the `DynamicComponent`.

### 4. **Decorator Pattern**:

   In Angular, decorators are used extensively. They modify classes or properties by adding metadata, like `@Component`, `@Directive`, `@Injectable`, etc.

   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-example',
     template: '<p>This is an example component</p>',
   })
   export class ExampleComponent {
     // Component logic here
   }
   ```

   Here, the `@Component` decorator is used to define the metadata for the `ExampleComponent`.

### 5. **Proxy Pattern**:

   The Proxy pattern is often used for lazy loading and caching in Angular. When implementing lazy loading, the router can use proxy components to load modules and components only when they are needed, improving application performance.

   ```typescript
   const routes: Routes = [
     {
       path: 'lazy',
       loadChildren: () => import('./lazy/lazy.module').then((m) => m.LazyModule),
     },
   ];
   ```

   In this example, the Proxy pattern is applied when loading the `LazyModule` only when the 'lazy' route is accessed.

### 6. **Strategy Pattern**:

   The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms and make them interchangeable. In Angular, you can use this pattern to create dynamic behavior for components or services based on different strategies.

   ```typescript
   interface PaymentStrategy {
     pay(amount: number): void;
   }

   class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
     pay(amount: number) {
       // Implement payment via credit card
     }
   }

   class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
     pay(amount: number) {
       // Implement payment via PayPal
     }
   }

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-payment',
     template: 'Payment component',
   })
   export class PaymentComponent {
     constructor(private paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy) {}

     processPayment(amount: number) {
       this.paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
     }
   }
   ```

   The `PaymentComponent` uses a strategy (either `CreditCardPayment` or `PayPalPayment) to process a payment.

### 7. **Command Pattern**:

   The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue requests, and support undoable operations. In Angular, you can use it to implement actions or operations that can be undone or redone.

   ```typescript
   class Light {
     turnOn() {
       // Implementation to turn on the light
     }

     turnOff() {
       // Implementation to turn off the light
     }
   }

   interface Command {
     execute(): void;
   }

   class TurnOnCommand implements Command {
     constructor(private light: Light) {}

     execute() {
       this.light.turnOn();
     }
   }

   class TurnOffCommand implements Command {
     constructor(private light: Light) {}

     execute() {
       this.light.turnOff();
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, the `Light` class is the receiver, and the `TurnOnCommand` and `TurnOffCommand` encapsulate the actions to be taken.

### 8. **Visitor Pattern**:

   The Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them. In Angular, you can use it to traverse and operate on the elements of complex data structures, such as the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in the context of a compiler or code analysis.

   ```typescript
   interface Visitor {
     visit(element: Element): void;
   }

   class ConcreteElementA {
     accept(visitor: Visitor) {
       visitor.visit(this);
     }
   }

   class ConcreteElementB {
     accept(visitor: Visitor) {
       visitor.visit(this);
     }
   }

   class ConcreteVisitor implements Visitor {
     visit(element: Element) {
       // Perform specific actions based on the element type
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `Visitor` interface defines the visit operation for elements, and the `ConcreteVisitor` implements the specific actions to be taken.

### 9. **Memento Pattern**:

   The Memento pattern allows you to capture an object's internal state so that it can be restored at a later time. In Angular, you can use it to implement undo/redo functionality or to store and restore the state of a component.

   ```typescript
   class Originator {
     private state: string;

     setMemento(memento: Memento) {
       this.state = memento.getState();
     }

     createMemento(): Memento {
       return new Memento(this.state);
     }
   }

   class Memento {
     constructor(private state: string) {}

     getState(): string {
       return this.state;
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, the `Originator` class can create and set mementos, allowing it to save and restore its state.

### 10. **Composite Pattern**:

   The Composite pattern lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. In Angular, this can be used for rendering hierarchical UI components or representing complex structures like a file system.

   ```typescript
   abstract class Component {
     abstract operation(): void;
   }

   class Leaf extends Component {
     operation() {
       // Perform operation for a leaf component
     }
   }

   class Composite extends Component {
     private children: Component[] = [];

     add(child: Component) {
       this.children.push(child);
     }

     operation() {
       for (const child of this.children) {
         child.operation();
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example, `Composite` can contain a collection of child components, which can be either `Leaf` or other `Composite` components, allowing for complex hierarchies.

These examples demonstrate how different design patterns can be implemented in Angular to improve the structure, scalability, and maintainability of your application.
