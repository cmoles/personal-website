SOLID is a set of principles in object-oriented programming aimed at making software more maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. I'll provide examples for each of the SOLID principles using Angular and TypeScript.

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

   The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In Angular, this can be exemplified by having components with a single responsibility. For instance, consider a component that fetches and displays user data:

   ```typescript
   // user.component.ts
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-user',
     template: '<div>{{ user.name }}</div>',
   })
   export class UserComponent {
     user: User;

     constructor(private userService: UserService) {
       this.user = this.userService.getUser();
     }
   }

   // user.service.ts
   @Injectable()
   export class UserService {
     getUser(): User {
       // Fetch user data from an API or other data source
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, `UserComponent` has one responsibility: to display user data, and `UserService` has the responsibility of fetching user data.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**:

   The OCP states that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In Angular, this can be demonstrated by using interfaces and inheritance:

   ```typescript
   interface Shape {
     area(): number;
   }

   class Circle implements Shape {
     constructor(public radius: number) {}

     area() {
       return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
     }
   }

   class Square implements Shape {
     constructor(public side: number) {}

     area() {
       return this.side ** 2;
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, new shapes can be added (extension) without modifying the existing `Shape` or `Circle` and `Square` classes.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:

   The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In Angular, this is applicable when using inheritance and polymorphism:

   ```typescript
   class Bird {
     fly() {
       // Common flying behavior
     }
   }

   class Penguin extends Bird {
     // Penguins cannot fly
     fly() {
       throw new Error("Penguins can't fly.");
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, a `Penguin` class inherits from `Bird` but overrides the `fly` method to throw an error because penguins can't fly. The LSP is satisfied because a `Penguin` object can be used wherever a `Bird` object is expected.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:

   The ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. In Angular, you can design services or components with specific, small interfaces:

   ```typescript
   interface CanSwim {
     swim(): void;
   }

   class Fish implements CanSwim {
     swim() {
       // Implement swim behavior
     }
   }

   class Bird {
     // Birds may not swim, but they're not forced to implement the swim method
   }
   ```

   Here, `Fish` implements the `CanSwim` interface, while `Bird` doesn't need to implement it because it's not relevant for birds.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:

   The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In Angular, this is achieved by using dependency injection and defining abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) for services:

   ```typescript
   interface DataService {
     getData(): any;
   }

   class HttpDataService implements DataService {
     getData() {
       // Fetch data via HTTP
     }
   }

   class MockDataService implements DataService {
     getData() {
       // Return mock data for testing
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, high-level components can depend on the `DataService` interface, and you can inject either `HttpDataService` or `MockDataService` based on your needs without changing the high-level component's code.

These examples demonstrate how SOLID principles can be applied in Angular and TypeScript to create maintainable and flexible software.
