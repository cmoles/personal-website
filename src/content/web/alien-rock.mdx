### Introducing Bob the Alien and Friends

Why browse the site alone when you can have a band accompany you?

Bob the Alien and Friends is a concept cartoon band I came up with when I was younger. Think Josie and the Pussy Cats but sarcastic grunge rockers instead of cheerful hotties. They're pretentious enough to think they're better, but, really, they're just jealous of their success.

Anyways, enjoy the radical, low-key hi-jinks of Bob the Alien and Friends.
